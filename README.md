# VLSI 
Very Large Scale Integration refers to the trend of integrating circuits into silicon chips. A typical
example is the smartphone. The modern trend of shrinking transistor sizes, allowing engineers to fit more
and more transistors into the same area of silicon, has pushed the integration of more and more functions
of cellphone circuitry into a single silicon die (i.e. plate).
This enabled the modern cellphone to mature into a powerful tool that shrank from the size of a large
brick-sized unit to a device small enough to comfortably carry in a pocket or purse, with a video camera,
touchscreen, and other advanced features.
The VLSI problem is analogous to “the strip packing problem”, from which we started our research.
Since this problem is strongly NP-hard the study of this problem has important practical and theoretical
significance  
  

The aim of this project is to find a solution to the VSLI problem for as many instances as possible.
A total of 40 instances are provided. We bring forward four possible methods: Constraint Programming
(CP), Propositional SATisfability (SAT), and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) and Mixed-Integer
Linear Programming (MIP).
